## Form ModelListener module with user creation - On boarding

First developed by the lovely guys at Liferay France Fabian and Louis. I ported it to Liferay 7.3.

Listens to a form entry and creates a user if the form is connected to a workflow. Upon completion of the workflow the user is activated.
